   abstract = {There is a lack in representation of biosphere atmosphere interactions in current climate models. To fill this gap, one may introduce vegetation dynamics in surface transfer schemes or couple global climate models (GCMs) with vegetation dynamics models. As these vegetation dynamics models were not designed to be included in GCMs, how are the latest generation dynamic global vegetation models (DGVMs) suitable for use in global climate studies? This paper reviews the latest developments in DGVM modelling as well as the development of DGVM-GCM coupling in the framework of global climate studies. Limitations of DGVM and coupling are shown and the challenges of these methods are highlighted. During the last decade, DGVMs underwent major changes in the representation of physical and biogeochemical mechanisms such as photosynthesis and respiration processes as well as in the representation of regional properties of vegetation. However, several limitations such as carbon and nitrogen cycles, competition, land-use and land-use changes, and disturbances have been identified. In addition, recent advances in model coupling techniques allow the simulation of the vegetation atmosphere interactions in GCMs with the help of DGVMs. Though DGVMs represent a good alternative to investigate vegetation atmosphere interactions at a large scale, some weaknesses in evaluation methodology and model design need to be further investigated to improve the results.},

   abstract = {This study tests the ability of five Dynamic Global Vegetation Models (DGVMs), forced with observed climatology and atmospheric CO2, to model the contemporary global carbon cycle. The DGVMs are also coupled to a fast 'climate analogue model', based on the Hadley Centre General Circulation Model (GCM), and run into the future for four Special Report Emission Scenarios (SRES): A1FI, A2, B1, B2. Results show that all DGVMs are consistent with the contemporary global land carbon budget. Under the more extreme projections of future environmental change, the responses of the DGVMs diverge markedly. In particular, large uncertainties are associated with the response of tropical vegetation to drought and boreal ecosystems to elevated temperatures and changing soil moisture status. The DGVMs show more divergence in their response to regional changes in climate than to increases in atmospheric CO2 content. All models simulate a release of land carbon in response to climate, when physiological effects of elevated atmospheric CO2 on plant production are not considered, implying a positive terrestrial climate-carbon cycle feedback. All DGVMs simulate a reduction in global net primary production (NPP) and a decrease in soil residence time in the tropics and extra-tropics in response to future climate. When both counteracting effects of climate and atmospheric CO2 on ecosystem function are considered, all the DGVMs simulate cumulative net land carbon uptake over the 21st century for the four SRES emission scenarios. However, for the most extreme A1FI emissions scenario, three out of five DGVMs simulate an annual net source of CO2 from the land to the atmosphere in the final decades of the 21st century. For this scenario, cumulative land uptake differs by 494 Pg C among DGVMs over the 21st century. This uncertainty is equivalent to over 50 years of anthropogenic emissions at current levels.},

   abstract = {Ecology Letters (2010) 13: 267–283 Abstract Predicting changes in community composition and ecosystem function in a rapidly changing world is a major research challenge in ecology. Traits-based approaches have elicited much recent interest, yet individual studies are not advancing a more general, predictive ecology. Significant progress will be facilitated by adopting a coherent theoretical framework comprised of three elements: an underlying trait distribution, a performance filter defining the fitness of traits in different environments, and a dynamic projection of the performance filter along some environmental gradient. This framework allows changes in the trait distribution and associated modifications to community composition or ecosystem function to be predicted across time or space. The structure and dynamics of the performance filter specify two key criteria by which we judge appropriate quantitative methods for testing traits-based hypotheses. Bayesian multilevel models, dynamical systems models and hybrid approaches meet both these criteria and have the potential to meaningfully advance traits-based ecology.},

   abstract = {Dynamic Global Vegetation Models (DGVMs) are indispensable for our understanding of climate change impacts. The application of traits in DGVMs is increasingly refined. However, a comprehensive analysis of the direct impacts of trait variation on global vegetation distribution does not yet exist. Here, we present such analysis as proof of principle. We run regressions of trait observations for leaf mass per area, stem-specific density, and seed mass from a global database against multiple environmental drivers, making use of findings of global trait convergence. This analysis explained up to 52% of the global variation of traits. Global trait maps, generated by coupling the regression equations to gridded soil and climate maps, showed up to orders of magnitude variation in trait values. Subsequently, nine vegetation types were characterized by the trait combinations that they possess using Gaussian mixture density functions. The trait maps were input to these functions to determine global occurrence probabilities for each vegetation type. We prepared vegetation maps, assuming that the most probable (and thus, most suited) vegetation type at each location will be realized. This fully traits-based vegetation map predicted 42% of the observed vegetation distribution correctly. Our results indicate that a major proportion of the predictive ability of DGVMs with respect to vegetation distribution can be attained by three traits alone if traits like stem-specific density and seed mass are included. We envision that our traits-based approach, our observation-driven trait maps, and our vegetation maps may inspire a new generation of powerful traits-based DGVMs.},

   abstract = {Aim Projections of future climate change suggest that regional climates may evolve to states that are unlike any climate regime found on Earth today. These climates will impose novel constraints on plant species, and are likely to give rise to plant associations that are compositionally unlike any found on Earth today. Here, we explore whether the geographical distribution of previously mapped no-analogue climates corresponds to the geographical distribution of simulated no-analogue vegetation under scenarios of global warming. Location Global landmasses. Methods We used JeDi, a process-based vegetation model that accounts for ecophysiological trade-offs in plant growth and survival, to identify the assembly of plant functional types into no-analogue associations under scenarios of global warming.We compared the geographical distribution of these no-analogue vegeta- tion types with those of no-analogue climates derived from seasonal temperature and precipitation.To better understand the climatic causes that lead to no-analogue vegetation, we performed a set of JeDi simulation experiments and compared them, as well as selected climate indices, with the geographical distribution of no-analogue vegetation. Finally, we explored the changes in plant characteristics leading to no-analogue vegetation composition. Results In our model simulations, a no-analogue vegetation type emerged in Northern Eurasia due to the interacting effects of rising temperatures and the prolongation of the growing season, combined with stable patterns in the seasonal insolation cycle. Future tropical biomes experiencing novel temperature and pre- cipitation regimes however, resemble contemporary vegetation despite significant losses of plant diversity. Main conclusions Our modelling study shows how no-analogue vegetation can emerge in response to novel climates produced by rising temperatures and stable insolation, while also suggesting that no-analogue climates do not necessarily lead to no-analogue vegetation types. This result underlines the importance of consid- ering plant diversity and the need to integrate ecophysiological knowledge through process-orientated models when projecting future vegetation.

However, most models are limited by how they define vegetation and by their simplistic representation of competition. We discuss how concepts from community assembly theory and coexistence theory can help to improve vegetation models. We further present a trait- and individual-based vegetation model (aDGVM2) that allows individual plants to adopt a unique combination of trait values. These traits define how individual plants grow and compete. A genetic optimization algorithm is used to simulate trait inheritance and reproductive isolation between individuals. These model properties allow the assembly of plant communities that are adapted to a site's biotic and abiotic conditions. The aDGVM2 simulates how environmental conditions influence the trait spectra of plant communities; that fire selects for traits that enhance fire protection and reduces trait diversity; and the emergence of life-history strategies that are suggestive of colonization-competition trade-offs. The aDGVM2 deals with functional diversity and competition fundamentally differently from current DGVMs. This approach may yield novel insights as to how vegetation may respond to climate change and we believe it could foster collaborations between functional plant biologists and vegetation modellers.},

   abstract = {<p><strong>Abstract.</strong> Terrestrial biosphere models typically abstract the immense diversity of vegetation forms and functioning into a relatively small set of predefined semi-empirical plant functional types (PFTs). There is growing evidence, however, from the field ecology community as well as from modelling studies that current PFT schemes may not adequately represent the observed variations in plant functional traits and their effect on ecosystem functioning. In this paper, we introduce the Jena Diversity-Dynamic Global Vegetation Model (JeDi-DGVM) as a new approach to terrestrial biosphere modelling with a richer representation of functional diversity than traditional modelling approaches based on a small number of fixed PFTs. <br><br> JeDi-DGVM simulates the performance of a large number of randomly generated plant growth strategies, each defined by a set of 15 trait parameters which characterize various aspects of plant functioning including carbon allocation, ecophysiology and phenology. Each trait parameter is involved in one or more functional trade-offs. These trade-offs ultimately determine whether a strategy is able to survive under the climatic conditions in a given model grid cell and its performance relative to the other strategies. The biogeochemical fluxes and land surface properties of the individual strategies are aggregated to the grid-cell scale using a mass-based weighting scheme. <br><br> We evaluate the simulated global biogeochemical patterns against a variety of field and satellite-based observations following a protocol established by the Carbon-Land Model Intercomparison Project. The land surface fluxes and vegetation structural properties are reasonably well simulated by JeDi-DGVM, and compare favourably with other state-of-the-art global vegetation models. We also evaluate the simulated patterns of functional diversity and the sensitivity of the JeDi-DGVM modelling approach to the number of sampled strategies. Altogether, the results demonstrate the parsimonious and flexible nature of a functional trade-off approach to global vegetation modelling, i.e. it can provide more types of testable outputs than standard PFT-based approaches and with fewer inputs. <br><br> The approach implemented here in JeDi-DGVM sets the foundation for future applications that will explore the impacts of explicitly resolving diverse plant communities, allowing for a more flexible temporal and spatial representation of the structure and function of the terrestrial biosphere.</p>},

Precipitation recycling refers to the feedback mechanism between the Earth’s surface and the atmosphere wherein the amount of water that is evapotranspired from a given region of the surface returns to the same area in the form of precipitation. Here we show, on average, 20% of the total rainfall in the basin is derived from local evapotranspiration processes indicating that the local contribution to the total precipitation represents a significant contribution to the regional water budget and plays an important role in the Amazon water cycle. However, the changes in the climate system due to anthropogenic forcings such as the increase in the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere and changes in land use and land cover (i.e. deforestation) can affect the precipitation recycling. Although the results presented here have produced new knowledge about the interactions between surface processes and the hydrologic cycle, the effects of anthropogenic climate change on the precipitation recycling in the Amazon basin requires further investigation.},

Soil physical properties were evaluated by digging 2-m-deep pits and by taking auger samples.Results: Soil physical properties were the best predictors of CWD stocks; 37% of its variation was explained by effective soil depth. CWD stocks had a two-fold variation across a gradient of physical soil constraints (i.e. effective soil depth, anoxia and soil structure). Average biomass per tree was related to physical soil constraints, which, in turn, had a strong relationship with local CWD stocks.Conclusions: Soil physical properties appear to control average biomass per tree (and through this affect forest structure and dynamics), which, in turn, is correlated with CWD production and stocks. © 2014 © 2014 Botanical Society of Scotland and Taylor & Francis.},

This forest alteration affects regional hydrology4–11 and the global carbon cycle12–14, but current analyses of these effects neglect an important deep-soil link between the water and carbon cycles. Using rainfall data, satellite imagery and field studies, we estimate here that half of the closed forests of Brazilian Amazonia depend on deep root systems to maintain green canopies during the dry season. Evergreen forests in northeastern Pará state maintain evapotranspiration during five-month dry periods by absorbing water from the soil to depths of more than 8m. In contrast, although the degraded pastures of this region also contain deep-rooted woody plants, most pasture plants substantially reduce their leaf canopy in response to seasonal drought, thus reducing dry-season evapotranspiration and increasing potential subsurface runoff relative to the forests they replace. Deep roots that extract water also provide carbon to the soil. The forest soil below 1 m depth contains more carbon than does above-ground biomass, and as much as 15% of this deep-soil carbon turns over on annual or decadal timescales. Thus, forest alteration that affects depth distributions of carbon inputs from roots may also affect net carbon storage in the soil.},

Nevertheless, it is unclear how the terrestrial carbon sink will evolve as climate and atmospheric composition continue to change. Here we analyse the historical evolution of the biomass dynamics of the Amazon rainforest over three decades using a distributed network of 321 plots. While this analysis confirms that Amazon forests have acted as a long-term net biomass sink, we find a long-term decreasing trend of carbon accumulation. Rates of net increase in above-ground biomass declined by one-third during the past decade compared to the 1990s. This is a consequence of growth rate increases levelling off recently, while biomass mortality persistently increased throughout, leading to a shortening of carbon residence times. Potential drivers for the mortality increase include greater climate variability, and feedbacks of faster growth on mortality, resulting in shortened tree longevity. The observed decline of the Amazon sink diverges markedly from the recent increase in terrestrial carbon uptake at the global scale, and is contrary to expectations based on models.},

   abstract = {Retinal projections were studied using modifications of the Nauta silver impregnation technique. Contralaterally, the retina projects to nucleus geniculatus lateralis pars dorsalis and pars ventralis, nucleus lentiform mesencephali and nucleus geniculatus pretectalis. A sparse projection was also observed to nucleus ovalis. An additional afferent thalamic projection to nucleus ventrolateralis was found in two cases. The retina projects ipsilaterally to the dorsolateral portion of nucleus geniculatus lateralis pars dorsalis, and sparsely to nucleus lentiformis mesencephali and nucleus geniculatus pretectalis. Nucleus posterodorsalis receives dense bilateral retinal projections. Contralaterally, the retina also projects to the superficial layers of the tectum (layers 8-13 of Ramon) and the nucleus opticus tegmenti. Armstrong's findings that the retinal projections in Natrix are qualitatively similar niche those in lizards were confirmed. However, there are marked quantitative differences among the various pathways and their corresponding nuclei. These differences are particularly striking in comparing the visual projections to the dorsal thalamus, the retinotectorotundal and the retinogeniculate systems. The first is reduced in volume and the second is markedly increased in volume in comparison with lizards. These data lend support to the theories of Walls that snakes evolved from fossorial lizards and of Underwood that the eyes of the lizards underwent reduction but not complete degeneration. Qualitatively the retinal projections are conservative among lizards and snakes, but a history of reduction of these pathways in ancestral snakes with a selective increase in the retinogeniculate system as a surface nich was reattained is reflected in the anatomy of this ophidian visual system.},

Earth system models exhibit a high degree of spread in predictions of land biogeochemistry, biogeophysics, and hydrology, which are sensitive to forcing from other model components. Based on insights from prior land model evaluation studies and community workshops, the authors developed an open source model benchmarking software package that generates graphical diagnostics and scores model performance in support of the International Land Model Benchmarking (ILAMB) project. Employing a suite of in situ, remote sensing, and reanalysis data sets, the ILAMB package performs comprehensive model assessment across a wide range of land variables and generates a hierarchical set of web pages containing statistical analyses and figures designed to provide the user insights into strengths and weaknesses of multiple models or model versions. Described here is the benchmarking philosophy and mathematical methodology embodied in the most recent implementation of the ILAMB package. Comparison methods unique to a few specific data sets are presented, and guidelines for configuring an ILAMB analysis and interpreting resulting model performance scores are discussed. ILAMB is being adopted by modeling teams and centers during model development and for model intercomparison projects, and community engagement is sought for extending evaluation metrics and adding new observational data sets to the benchmarking framework.},

   abstract = {MODIS primary production products (MOD17) are the first regular, near-real-time data sets for repeated monitoring of vegetation primary production on vegetated land at 1-km resolution at an 8-day interval. But both the inconsistent spatial resolution between the gridded meteorological data and MODIS pixels, and the cloud-contaminated MODIS FPAR/LAI (MOD15A2) retrievals can introduce considerable errors to Collection4 primary production (denoted as C4 MOD17) results. Here, we aim to rectify these problems through reprocessing key inputs to MODIS primary vegetation productivity algorithm, resulting in improved Collection5 MOD17 (here denoted as C5 MOD17) estimates. This was accomplished by spatial interpolation of the coarse resolution meteorological data input and with temporal filling of cloud-contaminated MOD15A2 data. Furthermore, we modified the Biome Parameter Look-Up Table (BPLUT) based on recent synthesized NPP data and some observed GPP derived from some flux tower measurements to keep up with the improvements in upstream inputs. Because MOD17 is one of the down-stream MODIS land products, the performance of the algorithm can be largely influenced by the uncertainties from upstream inputs, such as land cover, FPAR/LAI, the meteorological data, and algorithm itself. MODIS GPP fits well with GPP derived from 12 flux towers over North America. Globally, the 3-year MOD17 NPP is comparable to the Ecosystem Model-Data Intercomparison (EMDI) NPP data set, and global total MODIS GPP and NPP are inversely related to the observed atmospheric CO2 growth rates, and MEI index, indicating MOD17 are reliable products. From 2001 to 2003, mean global total GPP and NPP estimated by MODIS are 109.29 Pg C/year and 56.02 Pg C/year, respectively. Based on this research, the improved global MODIS primary production data set is now ready for monitoring ecological conditions, natural resources and environmental changes. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

   abstract = {Deforestation contributes 6–17% of global anthropogenic CO2 emissions to the atmosphere1. Large uncertainties in emission estimates arise from inadequate data on the carbon density of forests2 and the regional rates of deforestation. Consequently there is an urgent need for improved data sets that characterize the global distribution of aboveground biomass, especially in the tropics. Here we use multi-sensor satellite data to estimate aboveground live woody vegetation carbon density for pan-tropical ecosystems with unprecedented accuracy and spatial resolution. Results indicate that the total amount of carbon held in tropical woody vegetation is 228.7Pg C, which is 21% higher than the amount reported in the Global Forest Resources Assessment 2010 (ref. 3). At the national level, Brazil and Indonesia contain 35% of the total carbon stored in tropical forests and produce the largest emissions from forest loss. Combining estimates of aboveground carbon stocks with regional deforestation rates4 we estimate the total net emission of carbon from tropical deforestation and land use to be 1.0PgCyr−1 over the period 2000–2010—based on the carbon bookkeeping model. These new data sets of aboveground carbon stocks will enable tropical nations to meet their emissions reporting requirements (that is, United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change Tier 3) with greater accuracy.},

Here we present a "benchmark" map of biomass carbon stocks over 2.5 billion ha of forests on three continents, encompassing all tropical forests, for the early 2000s, which will be invaluable for REDD assessments at both project and national scales. We mapped the total carbon stock in live biomass (above- and belowground), using a combination of data from 4,079 in situ inventory plots and satellite light detection and ranging (Lidar) samples of forest structure to estimate carbon storage, plus optical and microwave imagery (1-km resolution) to extrapolate over the landscape. The total biomass carbon stock of forests in the study region is estimated to be 247 Gt C, with 193 Gt C stored aboveground and 54 Gt C stored belowground in roots. Forests in Latin America, sub-Saharan Africa, and Southeast Asia accounted for 49%, 25%, and 26% of the total stock, respectively. By analyzing the errors propagated through the estimation process, uncertainty at the pixel level (100 ha) ranged from ± 6% to ± 53%, but was constrained at the typical project (10,000 ha) and national (>1,000,000 ha) scales at ca. ± 5% and ca. ± 1%, respectively. The benchmark map illustrates regional patterns and provides methodologically comparable estimates of carbon stocks for 75 developing countries where previous assessments were either poor or incomplete.},

The resulting DNA fragments were fractionated according to size in preparative agarose gel electrophoresis. DNA fragments carrying gene sequences coding for the variable or constant region of k chains were detected by hybridization with purified, 125I-labeled, whole MOPC 321 K MRNA and with its 3'-end half. The pattern of hybridization was completely different in the genomes of embryo cells and of the plasmacytoma. The pattern of embryo DNA showed two components, one of which (molecular weight=6.0 million) hybridized with C-gene sequences and the other (molecular weight=3.9 million) with V-gene sequences. The pattern of the tumor DNA showed a single component that hybridized with both V-gene and C-gene sequences and that is smaller (molecular weight=2.4 million) than either of the components in embryo DNA. The results were interpreted to mean that the Vk and Ck genes, which are some distance away from each other in the embryo cells, are joined to form a contiguous polynucleotide stretch during differentiation of lymphocytes. Such joining occurs in both of the homologous chromosomes. Relevance of these findings with respect to models for V-C gene joining, activation of a specific V k gene, and allelic exclusion in immunoglobulin gene loci is discussed.},

These counterintuitive and technologically useful behaviours have spurred considerable efforts to synthesize a broad array of negative-index metamaterials with engineered electric, magnetic or optical properties. Here we demonstrate another route to negative refraction by exploiting the inertia of electrons in semiconductor two-dimensional electron gases, collectively accelerated by electromagnetic waves according to Newton's second law of motion, where this acceleration effect manifests as kinetic inductance. Using kinetic inductance to attain negative refraction was theoretically proposed for three-dimensional metallic nanoparticles and seen experimentally with surface plasmons on the surface of a three-dimensional metal. The two-dimensional electron gas that we use at cryogenic temperatures has a larger kinetic inductance than three-dimensional metals, leading to extraordinarily strong negative refraction at gigahertz frequencies, with an index as large as -700. This pronounced negative refractive index and the corresponding reduction in the effective wavelength opens a path to miniaturization in the science and technology of negative refraction.},

The results constitute the most geographically extensive, carefully calibrated, internally consistent CO2 data set available. Analysis of the data reveals that the global CO2 growth rate has declined from a peak of similar to 2.5 ppm yr(-1) in 1987-1988 to similar to 0.6 ppm yr(-1) in 1992. In 1992 we find no increase in atmospheric CO2 from 30 degrees to 90 degrees N. Variations in fossil fuel CO2 emissions cannot explain this result. The north pole-south pole CO2 difference increased from similar to 3 ppm during 1981-1987 to similar to 4 ppm during 1988-1991. In 1992 the difference was again similar to 3 ppm. A two-dimensional model analysis of the data indicates that the low CO2 growth rate in 1992 is mainly due to an increase in the northern hemisphere CO2 sink from 3.9 Gt C yr(-1) in 1991 to 5.0 Gt C yr(-1) in 1992. The increase in the north pole-south pole CO2 difference appears to result from an increase in the southern hemisphere CO2 sink from degrees 0.5 to degrees 1.5 Gt C yr(-1).},

   abstract = {Atmospheric transport models are used to constrain sources and sinks of carbon dioxide by requiring that the modeled spatial and temporal concentration patterns are consistent with the observations. Serious obstacles to this approach are the sparsity of sampling sites and the lack of temporal continuity among observations at different locations. A procedure is presented that attempts to extend the knowledge gained during a limited period of measurements beyond the period itself resulting in records containing measurement data and extrapolated and interpolated values. From limited measurements we can define trace gas climatologies that describe average seasonal cycles, trends, and changes in trends at individual sampling sites. A comparison of the site climatologies with a reference defined over a much longer period of time constitutes the framework used in the development of the data extension procedure. Two extension methods are described. The benchmark trend method uses a deseasonalized long-term trend from a single site as a reference to individual site climatologies. The latitude reference method utilizes measurements from many sites in constructing a reference to the climatologies. Both methods are evaluated and the advantages and limitations of each are discussed. Data extension is not based on any atmospheric models but entirely on the data themselves. The methods described here are relatively straightforward and reproducible and result in extended records that are model independent. The cooperative air sampling network maintained by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Climate Monitoring and Diagnostics Laboratory in Boulder, Colorado, provides a test bed for the development of the data extension method; we intend to integrate and extend CO2 measurement records from other laboratories providing a globally consistent atmospheric CO2 database to the modeling community.},

   abstract = {Dispersal is a fundamental determinant of species distribution and metapopulation structure, and freshwater species face strong challenges to disperse between hydrological catchments. Isolated freshwater lakes are inhabited by fish, posing the question of how were they colonized. It has often been proposed that fish dispersal to remote lakes can be facilitated by waterbirds, but there is no firm empirical evidence for such dispersal. We used field samples and experimental approach to demonstrate that eggs of two species of annual killifish are dispersed inside the digestive system of coscoroba swans in Brazil. An estimated one per cent of ingested killifish eggs were found to be viable in bird faeces and capable of continuing their development. Austrolebias minuano hatched after spending over 30 h inside a swan. Annual killifish eggs develop via diapausing stages that are primarily an adaptation to survive regular habitat desiccation and possess a thick chorion that may protect the eggs during their passage though the waterfowl gut, enabling such a unique form of fish dispersal. As well as being important over evolutionary time scales, this previously unknown dispersal mode may also be significant over ecological time scales, and explain surprising records of fish in closed‐basin lakes and pools.},

   abstract = {Water must be transported long distances in tall plants, resulting in increasing hydraulic resistance, which may place limitations on the maximum plant height (H max ) in a given habitat. However, the coordination of hydraulic traits with H max and habitat aridity remains poorly understood. To explore whether H max modifies the trade-off between hydraulic efficiency and safety or how water availability might influence the relationship between H max and other hydraulic traits, we compiled a dataset including H max and 11 hydraulic traits for 1281 woody species from 369 sites worldwide. We found that taller species from wet habitats exhibited greater xylem efficiency and lower hydraulic safety, wider conduits, lower conduit density, and lower sapwood density, which were all associated with habitat water availability. Plant height and hydraulic functioning appear to represent a single, coordinated axis of variation, aligned primarily with water availability, thus suggesting an important role for this axis in species sorting processes.},

   abstract = {Hydrologic analyses often involve the evaluation of soil water infiltration, conductivity, storage, and plant-water relationships. To define the hydrologic soil water effects requires estimating soil water characteristics for water potential and hydraulic conductivity using soil variables such as texture, organic matter (OM), and structure. Field or laboratory measurements are difficult, costly, and often impractical for many hydrologie analyses. Statistical correlations between soil texture, soil water potential, and hydraulic conductivity can provide estimates sufficiently accurate for many analyses and decisions. This study developed new soil water characteristic equations from the currently available USDA soil database using only the readily available variables of soil texture and OM. These equations are similar to those previously reported by Saxton et al. but include more variables and application range. They were combined with previously reported relationships for tensions and conductivities and the effects of density, gravel, and salinity to form a comprehensive predictive system of soil water characteristics for agricultural water management and hydrologic analyses. Verification was performed using independent data sets for a wide range of soil textures. The predictive system was programmed for a graphical computerized model to provide easy application and rapid solutions and is available at http://hydrolab. arsusda. gov/soilwater/Index.htm. © Soil Science Society of America.},

   abstract = {Hydrological models require the determination of fitting parameters that are tedious and time consuming to acquire. A rapid alternative method of estimating the fitting parameters is to use pedotransfer functions. This paper proposes a reliable method to estimate soil moisture at -33 and -1500 kPa from soil texture and bulk density. This method reduces the saturated moisture content by multiplying it with two non-linear functions depending on sand and clay contents. The novel pedotransfer function has no restrictions on the range of the texture predictors and gives reasonable predictions for soils with bulk density that varies from 0.25 to 2.16 g cm-3. These pedotransfer functions require only five parameters for each pressure head. It is generally accepted that the introduction of organic matter as a predictor improves the outcomes; however it was found by using a porosity based pedotransfer model, using organic matter as a predictor only modestly improves the accuracy. The model was developed employing 18 559 samples from the IGBP-DIS soil data set for pedotransfer function development (Data and Information System of the International Geosphere Biosphere Programme) database that embodies all major soils across the United States of America. The function is reliable and performs well for a wide range of soils occurring in very dry to very wet climates. Climatical grouping of the IGBP-DIS soils was proposed (aquic, tropical, cryic, aridic), but the results show that only tropical soils require specific grouping. Among many other different non-climatical soil groups tested, only humic and vitric soils were found to require specific grouping. The reliability of the pedotransfer function was further demonstrated with an independent database from Northern Italy having heterogeneous soils, and was found to be comparable or better than the accuracy of other pedotransfer functions found in the literature.},

   abstract = {Many pedotransfer functions (PTFs) have been developed for predicting the soil water content at different matric potentials. The use of these functions has been encouraged because of the time and work typically required for measuring it, while the PTFs require commonly measured soil properties such as sand, silt, clay, organic matter content, or bulk density for predicting water retention. In addition, several environmental and ecosystem management simulation models such as DRAINMOD, HYDRUS, EPIC, SPAW, and WEPP use PTFs for computing soil hydraulic properties. Because of the increasing use of the PTFs and their effect in many soil water simulation and transport models, this study revised and tested 13 different PTFs for predicting soil water content at −33 and −1500 kPa, values usually known as field capacity and wilting point. Three of these PTFs were derived from tropical soils while the rest were developed with soil samples collected across the United States. These PTFs were evaluated in Chilean soils as an independent dataset and their improvement after calibration was assessed with this new data. The results demonstrate that the PTFs performance depends on the soils used for their development as the estimates showed a significant improvement after calibration. When predicting water content, Rawls et al. (2004) was the best function before calibration (RMSE = 0.08 for −33 and −1500 kPa), while Gupta and Larson (1979) was the best after calibration (RMSE of 0.06 and 0.05, and r 2 values of 0.69 and 0.66 at −33 and −1500 kPa, respectively). Nonlinear PTFs performed better than linear PTFs when predicting water content at field capacity. Finally, bulk density proved to be the key variable and can be used as footprint for soils changes through time. Organic matter content was also a significant input but improved the estimates for some specific matric potentials and PTFs.},

   abstract = {Managing ecosystems to ensure the provision of multiple ecosystem services is a key challenge for applied ecology. Functional traits are receiving increasing attention as the main ecological attributes by which different organisms and biological communities influence ecosystem services through their effects on underlying ecosystem processes. Here we synthesize concepts and empirical evidence on linkages between functional traits and ecosystem services across different trophic levels. Most of the 247 studies reviewed considered plants and soil invertebrates, but quantitative trait-service associations have been documented for a range of organisms and ecosystems, illustrating the wide applicability of the trait approach. Within each trophic level, specific processes are affected by a combination of traits while particular key traits are simultaneously involved in the control of multiple processes. These multiple associations between traits and ecosystem processes can help to identify predictable trait-service clusters that depend on several trophic levels, such as clusters of traits of plants and soil organisms that underlie nutrient cycling, herbivory, and fodder and fibre production. We propose that the assessment of trait-service clusters will represent a crucial step in ecosystem service monitoring and in balancing the delivery of multiple, and sometimes conflicting, services in ecosystem management. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

The procedure first estimated representative soil properties for the FAO soil units by statistical analyses and taxotransfer depth algorithms [Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), 1996]. The representative soil properties estimated for two layers of depths (0-30 and 30-100 cm) included particle-size distribution, dominant soil texture, organic carbon content, coarse fragments, bulk density, and porosity. After representative soil properties for the FAO soil units were estimated, these values were substituted into three different pedotransfer functions (PTF) models by Rawls et al. [1982], Saxton et al. [1986], and Batjes [1996a]. The Saxton PTF model was finally selected to calculate available water content because it only required particle-size distribution data and results closely agreed with the Rawls and Batjes PTF models that used both particle-size distribution and organic matter data. Soil water-holding capacities were then estimated by multiplying the available water content by the soil layer thickness and integrating over an effective crop root depth of 1 m or less (i.e., encountered shallow impermeable layers) and another soil depth data layer of 2.5 m or less.},

The objectives of this study were: to generate pedotransfer functions to estimate soil water retention based on easily measurable soil properties; to evaluate the efficiency of existing pedotransfer functions for different geographical regions for the estimation of water retention in soils of Rio Grande do Sul (RS); and to estimate plant-available water capacity based on soil particle-size distribution. Two databases were set up for soil properties, including water retention: one based on literature data (725 entries) and the other with soil data from an irrigation scheduling and management system (239 entries). From the literature database, pedotransfer functions were generated, nine pedofunctions available in the literature were evaluated and the plant-available water capacity was calculated. The coefficient of determination of some pedotransfer functions ranged from 0.56 to 0.66. Pedotransfer functions generated based on soils from other regions were not appropriate for estimating the water retention for RS soils. The plant-available water content varied with soil texture classes, from 0.089 kg kg-1 for the sand class to 0.191 kg kg-1 for the silty clay class. These variations were more related to sand and silt than to clay content. The soils with a greater silt/clay ratio, which were less weathered and with a greater quantity of smectite clay minerals, had high water retention and plant-available water capacity.

   abstract = {RESUMO Elaborou-se um modelo de vegetação potencial (i.e., um modelo que diagnostica o bioma em equilíbrio com um dado clima) capaz de reproduzir a distribuição global dos principais biomas e, em escala regional, o mapa de vegetação da América do Sul. A partir da climatologia mensal de precipitação e temperatura do ar à superfície, obtêm-se um conjunto de variáveis ambientais: tempo térmico acumulado, temperatura média do mês mais frio e dois índices, um para diferenciar climas quentes de frios e outro para representar a sazonalidade do armazenamento de água do solo. Dado o conjunto de variáveis ambientais, o modelo gera como saída um bioma que pertence à classificação de vegetação utilizada pelo modelo de superfície SiB (ou SSiB). Para calcular os índices, elaborou-se um modelo de balanço hídrico simples, que considera o congelamento do solo e calcula a evapotranspiração real através da formulação de Penman-Monteith. O modelo de balanço hídrico consegue reproduzir a distribuição global de água do solo. Por comparação visual, nota-se que o modelo de vegetação potencial, chamado de CPTEC PVM, conseguiu reproduzir o padrão global dos principais biomas. Na América do Sul, o modelo foi capaz de reproduzir a vegetação dos Pampas e evita a substituição de caatinga por savanas. Uma análise objetiva mostrou que o desempenho do modelo, em escala global, é muito bom para floresta tropical e deserto; bom para floresta de coníferas, savana, semi-deserto e tundra; regular para floresta temperada, campos e caatinga; e ruim para floresta mista. Em geral, o desempenho do CPTEC PVM é comparável ao apresentado por outros modelos atualmente utilizados em estudos climáticos. Esse bom desempenho motiva o acoplamento do CPTEC PVM a modelos atmosféricos que utilizem o SiB (ou SSiB) como seu esquema de superfície.

ABSTRACT: A SIMPLE POTENTIAL VEGETATION MODEL FOR COUPLING WITH THE SIMPLE BIOSPHERE MODEL (SIB) A simple potential vegetation model (i.e., a model which diagnoses the biome in equilibrium with a given climate) was developed. Given a set of environmental variables derived from climatologies of monthly mean surface temperature and precipitation-namely, growing degree-days, temperature of the coldest month and two moisture indices (one to distinguish between wet and dry climates and the other to represent soil moisture seasonality)-the model outputs a biome of the vegetation classification used in SiB (or SSiB) land surface scheme. A water balance model-which includes the possibility of soil water freezing and evalutates the actual evapotranspiration using the Penman-Monteith formulation-was developed to calculate the two moisture indices. The water balance model produces a consistent global distribution of soil moisture. The potential vegetation model, named CPTEC PVM, was able to represent the global biome patterns. On a regional level in South America, the model was able to reproduce the Pampas grasslands and avoid the replacement of caatinga by savannas in Northeast Brazil. Objective analysis for each biome revealed a very good agreement for tropical forests and deserts; good agreement for conifer forests, savannas, semi-deserts and tundra; regular agreement for temperate forest, grasslands and caatinga vegetation; and poor agreement for mixed forest. In general, the model skill is comparable to other potential vegetation models currently in use for climate studies. The good skill showed by CPTEC PVM motivates its coupling to AGCM's that use SiB (or SSiB) as its land surface model to create a dynamic vegetation model.},

   abstract = {Earth's vegetation plays a pivotal role in the global water balance. Hence, there is a need to model dynamic interactions and feedbacks between the terrestrial biosphere and the water cycle. Here, the hydrological performance of the Lund-Potsdam-Jena model (LPJ), a prominent dynamic global vegetation model, is evaluated. Models of this type simulate the coupled terrestrial carbon and water cycle, thus they are well suited for investigating biosphere-hydrosphere interactions over large domains. We demonstrate that runoff and evapotranspiration computed by LPJ agree well with respective results from state-of-the-art global hydrological models, while in some regions, runoff is significantly over- or underestimated compared to observations. The direction and magnitude of these biases is largely similar to those from other macro-scale models, rather than specific to LPJ. They are attributable primarily to uncertainties in the climate input data, and to human interventions not considered by the model (e.g. water withdrawal, land cover conversions). Additional model development is required to perform integrated assessments of water exchanges among the biosphere, the hydrosphere, and the anthroposphere. Yet, the LPJ model can now be used to study inter-relations between the world's major vegetation types and the terrestrial water balance. As an example, it is shown that a doubling of atmospheric CO2 content alone would result in pronounced changes in evapotranspiration and runoff for many parts of the world. Although significant, these changes would remain unseen by stand-alone hydrological models, thereby emphasizing the importance of simulating the coupled carbon and water cycle. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

Features include feedback through canopy conductance between photosynthesis and transpiration and interactive coupling between thesèfast' processes and other ecosystem processes including resource competition , tissue turnover, population dynamics, soil organic matter and litter dynamics and fire disturbance. Ten plants functional types (PFTs) are differentiated by physiological, morphological, phenological, bioclimatic and fire-response attributes. Resource competition and differential responses to fire between PFTs influence their relative fractional cover from year to year. Photosynthesis, evapotranspiration and soil water dynamics are modelled on a daily time step, while vegetation structure and PFT population densities are updated annually. Simulations have been made over the industrial period both for specific sites where field measurements were available for model evaluation, and globally on a 0.58 8 3 0.58 8 grid. Modelled vegetation patterns are consistent with observations, including remotely sensed vegetation structure and phenology. Seasonal cycles of net ecosystem exchange and soil moisture compare well with local measurements. Global carbon exchange fields used as input to an atmospheric tracer transport model (TM2) provided a good fit to observed seasonal cycles of CO 2 concentration at all latitudes. Simulated inter-annual variability of the global terrestrial carbon balance is in phase with and comparable in amplitude to observed variability in the growth rate of atmospheric CO 2. Global terrestrial carbon and water cycle parameters (pool sizes and fluxes) lie within their accepted ranges.

While this is partly driven by changing precipitation, with well-known Earth system model uncertainties, here we show that the influence of plant stomatal conductance feedbacks can cause equally large changes in regional flood extremes and even act as the main control on future low latitude streamflow. Over most tropical land masses, modern climate predictions suggest that plant physiological effects will boost streamflow, overwhelming opposing effects of soil drying driven by the effects of CO2 on atmospheric radiation, warming and rainfall redistribution. The relatively unknown uncertainties in representing eco-physiological processes must therefore be better constrained in land-surface models. To this end, we identify a distinct plant physiological fingerprint on annual peak, low and mean discharge throughout the tropics and identify river basins where physiological responses dominate radiative responses to rising CO2 in modern climate projections.},

   abstract = {Models of vegetation function are widely used to predict the effects of climate change on carbon, water and nutrient cycles of terrestrial ecosystems, and their feedbacks to climate. Stomatal conductance, the process that governs plant water use and carbon uptake, is fundamental to such models. In this paper, we reconcile two long-standing theories of stomatal conductance. The empirical approach, which is most commonly used in vegetation models, is phenomenological, based on experimental observations of stomatal behaviour in response to environmental conditions. The optimal approach is based on the theoretical argument that stomata should act to minimize the amount of water used per unit carbon gained. We reconcile these two approaches by showing that the theory of optimal stomatal conductance can be used to derive a model of stomatal conductance that is closely analogous to the empirical models. Consequently, we obtain a unified stomatal model which has a similar form to existing empirical models, but which now provides a theoretical interpretation for model parameter values. The key model parameter, g1, is predicted to increase with growth temperature and with the marginal water cost of carbon gain. The new model is fitted to a range of datasets ranging from tropical to boreal trees. The parameter g1 is shown to vary with growth temperature, as predicted, and also with plant functional type. The model is shown to correctly capture responses of stomatal conductance to changing atmospheric CO2, and thus can be used to test for stomatal acclimation to elevated CO2. The reconciliation of the optimal and empirical approaches to modelling stomatal conductance is important for global change biology because it provides a simple theoretical framework for analyzing, and simulating, the coupling between carbon and water cycles under environmental change. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

   abstract = {The LI-COR 6400 portable photosynthesis system is the most widely used and cited instrument for measuring leaf gas exchange in plant physiology. The focus of this paper is to evaluate three ways of computing/measuring leaf temperature: the LI-COR energy budget computation, the LI-COR leaf thermocouple (T/C), and an infra-red (IR) sensor chip (MLX90615) incorporated into the LI-6400 leaf chamber. The IR-sensor was calibrated against known targets, and then used to cross check the other two methods. The results showed that the IR-sensor was superior to the LI-COR thermocouple and agreed closer with the energy budget values of leaf temperature. The magnitudes of the errors were quantified in terms of °C difference in leaf temperature measured by T/C (as control) and IR sensor versus percentage difference in stomatal conductance (gs) and intercellular CO2 concentration (Ci) computed from leaf temperature. The temperature difference (IR versus other methods) in the range of -1.89 to 1.58 °C resulted in relative errors in gs from 14.7% to -18.0% and Ci from 16.5% to -7.8% of the values reported by the standard LI-6400 calculations depending on species and temperature. Reasons are given for trusting the IR-sensor over the other methods and it is suggested that the next generation LI-COR photosynthesis system include an IR-sensor.},

We test an implementation of an optimal stomatal conductance model within the Community Atmosphere Biosphere Land Exchange (CABLE) land surface model (LSM). In common with many LSMs, CABLE does not differentiate between gs model parameters in relation to plant functional type (PFT), but instead only in relation to photosynthetic pathway. We constrained the key model parameter "g1", which represents plant water use strategy, by PFT, based on a global synthesis of stomatal behaviour. As proof of concept, we also demonstrate that the g1 parameter can be estimated using two long-term average (1960-1990) bioclimatic variables: (i) temperature and (ii) an indirect estimate of annual plant water availability. The new stomatal model, in conjunction with PFT parameterisations, resulted in a large reduction in annual fluxes of transpiration (∼ 30% compared to the standard CABLE simulations) across evergreen needleleaf, tundra and C4 grass regions. Differences in other regions of the globe were typically small. Model performance against upscaled data products was not degraded, but did not noticeably reduce existing model-data biases. We identified assumptions relating to the coupling of the vegetation to the atmosphere and the parameterisation of the minimum stomatal conductance as areas requiring further investigation in both CABLE and potentially other LSMs. We conclude that optimisation theory can yield a simple and tractable approach to predicting stomatal conductance in LSMs.},

   abstract = {Prediction of stomatal conductance is a key element to relate and scale up leaf-level gas exchange processes to canopy, ecosystem and land surface models. The empirical models that are typically employed for this purpose are simple and elegant formulations which relate stomatal conductance on a leaf area basis to the net rate of CO2 assimilation, humidity and CO2 concentration. Although light intensity is not directly modelled as a stomatal opening cue, it is well-known that stomata respond strongly to light. One response mode depends specifically on the blue-light part of the light spectrum, whereas the quantitative or ‘red’ light response is less spectrally defined and relies more on the quantity of incident light. Here, we present a modification of an empirical stomatal conductance model which explicitly accounts for the stomatal red-light response, based on a mesophyll-derived signal putatively initiated by the chloroplastic plastoquinone redox state. The modified model showed similar prediction accuracy compared to models using a relationship between stomatal conductance and net assimilation rate. However, fitted parameter values with the modified model varied much less across different measurement conditions, lessening the need for frequent re-parameterization to different conditions required of the current model. We also present a simple and easy to parameterize extension to the widely used Farquhar–Von Caemmerer–Berry photosynthesis model to facilitate coupling with the modified stomatal conductance model, which should enable use of the new stomatal conductance model to simulate ecosystem water vapour exchange in terrestrial biosphere models.},

   abstract = {Predicted responses of transpiration to elevated atmospheric CO2 concentration (eCO2) are highly variable amongst process-based models. To better understand and constrain this variability amongst models, we conducted an intercomparison of 11 ecosystem models applied to data from two forest free-air CO2 enrichment (FACE) experiments at Duke University and Oak Ridge National Laboratory. We analysed model structures to identify the key underlying assumptions causing differences in model predictions of transpiration and canopy water use efficiency. We then compared the models against data to identify model assumptions that are incorrect or are large sources of uncertainty. We found that model-to-model and model-to-observations differences resulted from four key sets of assumptions, namely (i) the nature of the stomatal response to elevated CO2 (coupling between photosynthesis and stomata was supported by the data); (ii) the roles of the leaf and atmospheric boundary layer (models which assumed multiple conductance terms in series predicted more decoupled fluxes than observed at the broadleaf site); (iii) the treatment of canopy interception (large intermodel variability, 2-15%); and (iv) the impact of soil moisture stress (process uncertainty in how models limit carbon and water fluxes during moisture stress). Overall, model predictions of the CO2 effect on WUE were reasonable (intermodel μ = approximately 28% ± 10%) compared to the observations (μ = approximately 30% ± 13%) at the well-coupled coniferous site (Duke), but poor (intermodel μ = approximately 24% ± 6%; observations μ = approximately 38% ± 7%) at the broadleaf site (Oak Ridge). The study yields a framework for analysing and interpreting model predictions of transpiration responses to eCO2, and highlights key improvements to these types of models. © 2013 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

   abstract = {Tropical wet forests are complex ecosystems with a large number of plant species. These environments are characterized by a high water availability throughout the whole year and a complex canopy structure. However, how the different sections of the canopy contribute to total evaporation is poorly understood. The aim of this work is to estimate the total evaporation flux and differentiate the contribution among canopy layers of a tropical wet forest in Costa Rica. The fluxes were monitored during the dry season by making use of the energy balance to quantify the fluxes and stable water isotopes to trace the sources of water vapor. Total evaporation was 275.5 mm and represents 55.9 % of the recorded precipitation (498.8 mm), with 11.7 % of the precipitation being intercepted and evaporated along the forest canopy. The understory beneath 8 m contributed 23.6 % of the evaporation, and almost half of it comes from the first 2 m of the understory. Stable water isotope signatures show different soil water sources depending on the plant type. Palms make use of a water source with an isotope signature similar to precipitation and throughfall. Soil water with a fractionated signature is used by trees, bushes and lianas. The isotope signature of water vapor samples overlap among different heights, but it was not possible to make use of the Keeling plot method due to the similar isotope signature of the possible sources of water vapor as well as the high water concentration even on the dryer days.},

Here, Populus balsamifera (BS, isohydric genotype), P. simonii (SI, previously uncharacterized stomatal behaviour), and their cross, P. balsamifera x simonii (BSxSI, anisohydric genotype) were studied to assess the physiological basis for biomass accumulation and water-use efficiency across a range of water availabilities. Under ample water, whole plant stomatal conductance (gs), transpiration (E), and growth rates were higher in anisohydric genotypes (SI and BSxSI) than in isohydric poplars (BS). Under drought, all genotypes regulated the leaf to stem water potential gradient via changes in gs, synchronizing leaf hydraulic conductance (Kleaf) and E: isohydric plants reduced Kleaf, gs, and E, whereas anisohydric genotypes maintained high Kleaf and E, which reduced both leaf and stem water potentials. Nevertheless, SI poplars reduced their plant hydraulic conductance (Kplant) during water stress and, unlike, BSxSI plants, recovered rapidly from drought. Low gs of the isohydric BS under drought reduced CO2 assimilation rates and biomass potential under moderate water stress. While anisohydric genotypes had the fastest growth under ample water and higher photosynthetic rates under increasing water stress, isohydric poplars had higher water-use efficiency. Overall, the results indicate three strategies for how closely related biomass species deal with water stress: survival-isohydric (BS), sensitive-anisohydric (BSxSI), and resilience-anisohydric (SI). Implications for woody biomass growth, water-use efficiency, and survival under variable environmental conditions are discussed.},

   abstract = {Spatial and temporal variation in wet canopy conditions following precipitation events can influence processes such as transpiration and photosynthesis, which can be further enhanced as upper canopy leaves dry more rapidly than the understory following each event. As part of a larger study aimed at improving land surface modelling of evapotranspiration processes in wet tropical forests, we compared transpiration among trees with exposed and shaded crowns under both wet and dry canopy conditions in central Costa Rica, which has an average 4200 mm annual rainfall. Transpiration was estimated for 5 months using 43 sap flux sensors in eight dominant, ten midstory and eight suppressed trees in a mature forest stand surrounding a 40-m tower equipped with micrometeorological sensors. Dominant trees were 13% of the plot's trees and contributed around 76% to total transpiration at this site, whereas midstory and suppressed trees contributed 18 and 5%, respectively. After accounting for vapour pressure deficit and solar radiation, leaf wetness was a significant driver of sap flux, reducing it by as much as 28%. Under dry conditions, sap flux rates (Js) of dominant trees were similar to midstory trees and were almost double that of suppressed trees. On wet days, all trees had similarly low Js. As expected, semi-dry conditions (dry upper canopy) led to higher Js in dominant trees than midstory, which had wetter leaves, but semi-dry conditions only reduced total stand transpiration slightly and did not change the relative proportion of transpiration from dominant and midstory. Therefore, models that better capture forest stand wet–dry canopy dynamics and individual tree water use strategies are needed to improve accuracy of predictions of water recycling over tropical forests.

   abstract = {Most leaf functional trait studies in the Amazon basin do not consider ontogenetic variations (leaf age), which may influence ecosystem productivity throughout the year. When leaf age is taken into account, it is generally considered discontinuous, and leaves are classified into age categories based on qualitative observations. Here, we quantified age-dependent changes in leaf functional traits such as the maximum carboxylation rate of ribulose-1,5-biphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco) (Vcmax), stomatal control (Cgs%), leaf dry mass per area and leaf macronutrient concentrations for nine naturally growing Amazon tropical trees with variable phenological strategies. Leaf ages were assessed by monthly censuses of branch-level leaf demography; we also performed leaf trait measurements accounting for leaf chronological age based on days elapsed since the first inclusion in the leaf demography, not predetermined age classes. At the tree community scale, a nonlinear relationship between Vcmax and leaf age existed: young, developing leaves showed the lowest mean photosynthetic capacity, increasing to a maximum at 45 days and then decreasing gradually with age in both continuous and categorical age group analyses. Maturation times among species and phenological habits differed substantially, from 8 ± 30 to 238 ± 30 days, and the rate of decline of Vcmax varied from −0.003 to −0.065 μmol CO2 m−2 s−1 day−1. Stomatal control increased significantly in young leaves but remained constant after peaking. Mass-based phosphorus and potassium concentrations displayed negative relationships with leaf age, whereas nitrogen did not vary temporally. Differences in life strategies, leaf nutrient concentrations and phenological types, not the leaf age effect alone, may thus be important factors for understanding observed photosynthesis seasonality in Amazonian forests. Furthermore, assigning leaf age categories in diverse tree communities may not be the recommended method for studying carbon uptake seasonality in the Amazon, since the relationship between Vcmax and leaf age could not be confirmed for all trees.},

Responses were evaluated in relation to one another, and to seasonal patterns and natural environmental stresses, including high temperatures, vapour pressure deficits (VPD), and drought. Photosynthetic CO2 assimilation (A) averaged 46% higher in the +200 μmol mol-1 CO2 treatment, in mid- and upper canopy foliage. Stomatal conductance (gs) averaged 14% (mid-canopy) and 24% (upper canopy) lower under CO2 enrichment. Variations in the relative responses of A and gs were linked, such that greater relative stimulation of A was observed on dates when relative reductions in gs were slight. Dry soils and high VPD reduced gs and A in both treatments, and tended to diminish treatment differences. The absolute effects of CO2 on A and gs were minimized whenever gs was low (<0-15 mol m-2 s-1), but relative effects, as the ratio of elevated to ambient rates, varied greatly under those conditions. Both stomatal and non-stomatal limitations of A were involved during late season droughts. Leaf temperature had a limited influence on A and gs, and there was no detectable relationship between prevailing temperature and CO2 effects on A or gs. The responsiveness of A and gs to elevated CO2, both absolute and relative, was maintained through time and within the canopy of this forest stand, subject to seasonal constraints and variability associated with limiting air and soil moisture.},

   abstract = {Forests exchange large amounts of CO 5 with the atmosphere and can influence and be influenced by atmospheric CO . There has been a recent proliferation of literature on the effects of atmospheric CO on forest trees. More 5 5 than 300 studies of trees on five different continents have been published in the last five years. These include an increasing number of field studies with a long-term focus and involving CO 5 istress or environment interactions. The recent data on long-term effects of elevated atmospheric CO on trees indicate a potential for a persistent 5 enhancement of tree growth for several years, although the only relevant long-term datasets currently available are for juvenile trees. The current literature indicates a significantly larger average long-term biomass increment under elevated CO 5 for conifers (130%) than for deciduous trees (49%) in studies not involving stress components. However, stimulation of photosynthesis by elevated CO 5 in long-term studies was similar for conifers (62%) and deciduous trees (53%). Recent studies indicate that elevated CO causes a more persistent stimulation of biomass increment 5 and photosynthesis than previously expected. Results of seedling studies, however, might not be applicable to other stages of tree development because of complications of age-dependent and size-dependent shifts in physiology and carbon allocation, which are accelerated by elevated CO 5 . In addition, there are many possible avenues to down-regulation, making the predicted canopy CO exchange and growth of mature trees and forests 5 in a CO -rich atmosphere uncertain. Although, physiological down-regulation of photosynthetic rates has been 5 documented in field situations, it is rarely large enough to offset entirely photosynthetic gains in elevated CO .A 5 persistent growth stimulation of individual mature trees has been demonstrated although this effect is more uncertain in trees in natural stands. Resource interactions can both constrain tree responses to elevated CO 5 and be altered by them. Although drought can reduce gas-exchange rates and offset the benefits of elevated CO , even in well watered trees, stomatal 5 conductance is remarkably less responsive to elevated CO than in herbaceous species. Stomata of a number of tree 5 species have been demonstrated to be unresponsive to elevated CO . We conclude that positive effects of CO on 5 5 leaf area can be at least as important in determining canopy transpiration as negative, direct effects of CO on 5 stomatal aperture. With respect to nutrition, elevated CO has the potential to alter tree–soil interactions that 5 might influence future changes in ecosystem productivity. There is continued evidence that in most cases nutrient limitations diminish growth and photosynthetic responses to elevated CO 5 at least to some degree, and that elevated CO can accelerate the appearance of nutrient limitations with increasing time of treatment. In many 5 studies, tree biomass responses to CO are artefacts in the sense that they are merely responses to CO -induced 5 5 changes in internal nutritional status of the tree. There are numerous interactions between CO 5 and factors of the biotic and abiotic environment. The importance of increasing atmospheric CO concentrations for productivity is likely to be overestimated if these are 5 not taken into account. Many interactions, however, are simply additive rather than synergistic or antagonistic. This appears to hold true for many parameters under elevated CO 5 in combination with temperature, elevated O , 6 and other atmospheric pollutants. However, there is currently little evidence that elevated CO will counteract O 5 6 damage. When the foliage content of C, mineral nutrients and secondary metabolites is altered by elevated CO , 5 treeiinsect interactions are modified. In most trees, mycorrhizal interactions might be less important for direct effects of CO 5 than for alleviating general nutrient deficiencies. Since many responses to elevated CO and their interactions with stress show considerable variability among 5 species?genotypes, one principal research need is for comparative studies of a large variety of woody species and ecosystems under realistic conditions. We still need more long-term experiments on mature trees and stands to address critical scaling issues likely to advance our understanding of responses to elevated CO 5 at different stages of forest development and their interactions with climate and environment. The only tools available at present for coping with the consequences of rising CO 5 are management of resources and selection of genotypes suitable for the future climate and environment. Key},

   abstract = {The hydrological response of forests to rising CO2 is a critical biotic feedback in the study of global climate change. Few studies, however, have investigated this highly dynamic response at relevant temporal and spatial scales. A combination of leaf and whole-tree measurements and stand-level extrapolations were used to assess how stomatal conductance, canopy transpiration and conductance, and evapotranspiration might be affected by future, higher CO2 concentrations. Midday measurements of stomatal conductance for leaves sampled in a 12-yr-old sweetgum (Liquidambar styraciflua) stand exposed to free-air CO2 enrichment were up to 44% lower at elevated than at ambient CO2 concentrations, whereas canopy conductance, averaged over the growing season, was only 14% lower in stands exposed to CO2 enrichment. The magnitude of this response was dependent on vapor pressure deficit and soil water potential. Annual estimates of evapotranspiration showed relatively small reductions due to atmospheric CO2 enrichment. These data illustrate that the hydrological response of a closed-canopy plantation to elevated CO2 depends on the temporal and spatial scale of observation. They emphasize the importance of interacting variables and confirm that integration of measurements over space and time reduce what, at the leaf level, might otherwise appear to be a large and significant response.},

   abstract = {Estimating rates of speciation and extinction, and understanding how and why they vary over evolutionary time, geographical space and species groups, is a key to understanding how ecological and evolutionary processes generate biological diversity. Such inferences will increasingly benefit from phylogenetic approaches given the ever-accelerating rates of genetic sequencing. In the last few years, models designed to understand diversification from phylogenetic data have advanced significantly. Here, I review these approaches and what they have revealed about diversification in the natural world. I focus on key distinctions between different models, and I clarify the conclusions that can be drawn from each model. I identify promising areas for future research. A major challenge ahead is to develop models that more explicitly take into account ecology, in particular the interaction of species with each other and with their environment. This will not only improve our understanding of diversification; it will also present a new perspective to the use of phylogenies in community ecology, the science of interaction networks and conservation biology, and might shift the current focus in ecology on equilibrium biodiversity theories to non-equilibrium theories recognising the crucial role of history. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd/CNRS.},

   abstract = {Two different plant strategies exist to deal with shade: shade avoidance and shade tolerance. All shade-exposed plants optimize photosynthesis to adapt to the decrease in light quality and quantity. When shaded, most species in open habitats express the shade-avoidance syndrome, a growth response to escape shade. Shade-tolerant species from forest understories cannot outgrow surrounding trees and adopt a tolerance response. Unlike shade avoidance, virtually nothing is known about regulation of shade tolerance. In this opinion article, we discuss potential modes of molecular regulation to adopt a shade-tolerance rather than a shade-avoidance strategy. We argue that molecular approaches using model and non-model species should help identify the molecular pathways that underpin shade tolerance, thus providing knowledge for further crop improvement. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

   abstract = {Light gradients are ubiquitous in nature, so all plants are exposed to some degree of shade during their lifetime. The minimum light required for survival, shade tolerance, is a crucial life-history trait that plays a major role in plant community dynamics. There is consensus on the suites of traits that influence shade tolerance, but debate over the relative importance of traits maximizing photosynthetic carbon gain in low light versus those minimizing losses. Shade tolerance is influenced by plant ontogeny and by numerous biotic and abiotic factors. Although phenotypic plasticity tends to be low in shade-tolerant species (e.g., scant elongation in low light), plasticity for certain traits, particularly for morphological features optimizing light capture, can be high. Understanding differential competitive potentials among cooccurring species mediated by shade tolerance is critical to predict ecosystem responses to global change drivers such as elevated CO2, climate change and the spread of invasive species.

   abstract = {The aim of this work was to determine the impact of three levels of [CO 2] and two levels of soil-nutrient availability on the growth and physiological responses of two tropical tree species differing in their ecological group: Croton urucurana Baillon, a pioneer (P), and also Cariniana legalis (Martius) Kuntze, a late succession (LS). We aimed to test the hypothesis that P species have stronger response to elevated [CO 2] than LS species as a result of differences in photosynthetic capacity and growth kinetics between both functional groups. Seedlings of both species were grown in open-top-chambers under high (HN) or low (LN) soil-nutrient supply and exposed to ambient (380μmolmol -1) or elevated (570 and 760μmolmol -1) [CO 2]. Measurements of gas exchange, chlorophyll a fluorescence, seedling biomass and allocation were made after 70 days of treatment. Results suggest that elevated [CO 2] significantly enhances the photosynthetic rates (A) and biomass production in the seedlings of both species, but that soil-nutrient supply has the potential to modify the response of young tropical trees to elevated [CO 2]. In relation to plants grown in ambient [CO 2], the P species grown under 760μmolmol -1 [CO 2] showed increases of 28% and 91% in A when grown in LN and HN, respectively. In P species grown under 570μmolmol -1 [CO 2], A increased by 16% under HN, but there was no effect in LN. In LS species, the enhancement of A by effect of 760μmolmol -1 [CO 2] was 30% and 70% in LN and HN, respectively. The exposure to 570μmolmol -1 [CO 2] stimulated A by 31% in HN, but was no effect in LN. Reductions in stomatal conductance (g s) and transpiration (E), as a result of elevated [CO 2] were observed. Increasing the nutrient supply from low to high increased both the maximum rate of carboxylation (V cmax) and maximum potential rate of electron transport (J max). As the level of [CO 2] increased, both the V cmax and the J max were found to decrease, whereas the J max/V cmax ratio increased. In the LS species, the maximum efficiency of PSII (F v/F m) was higher in the 760μmolmol -1 [CO 2] treatment relative to other [CO 2] treatments. The results suggest that when grown under HN and the highest [CO 2], the performance of the P species C. urucurana, in terms of photosynthesis and biomass enhancement, is better than the LS species C. legalis. However, a larger biomass is allocated to roots when C. legalis seedlings were exposed to elevated [CO 2]. This response would be an important strategy for plant survival and productivity of the LS species under drought stresses conditions on tropical environments in a global-change scenario. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.},
